It is the seat of King County, Washington. With a 2022 population of 749,256 it is the most populous city in both the state of Washington and the Pacific Northwest region of North America. The Seattle metropolitan area\\'s population is 4.02 million, making it the 15th-largest in the United States. Its growth rate of 21.1% between 2010 and 2020 made it one of the country\\'s fastest-growing large cities.Seattle is situated on an isthmus between Puget Sound (an inlet of the Pacific Ocean) and Lake Washington. It is the northernmost major city in the United States, located about 100 miles (160 km) south of the Canadian border. A major gateway for trade with East Asia, the Port of Seattle is the fourth-largest port in North America in terms of container handling as of 2021.The Seattle area has been inhabited by Native Americans (such as the Duwamish, who had at least 17 villages around Elliot Bay) for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent European settlers. Arthur A. Denny and his group of travelers, subsequently known as the Denny Party, arrived from Illinois via Portland, Oregon, on the schooner Exact at Alki Point on November 13, 1851. The settlement was moved to the eastern shore of Elliott Bay in 1852 and named \"Seattle\" in honor of Chief Seattle, a prominent 19th century leader of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribes. Seattle currently has high populations of Native Americans alongside Americans with strong Asian, African, European, and Scandinavian ancestry, and hosts the sixth-largest LGBT community in the U.S.Logging was Seattle\\'s first major industry, but by the late 19th century, the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush. Growth after World War II was partially due to the local Boeing company, which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturing. The Seattle area developed into a technology center from the 1980s onwards with companies like Microsoft becoming established in the region; Microsoft founder Bill Gates is a Seattleite by birth. Internet retailer Amazon was founded in Seattle in 1994, and major airline Alaska Airlines is based in SeaTac, Washington, serving Seattle\\'s international airport, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. The stream of new software, biotechnology, and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city\\'s population by almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000.\\nThe culture of Seattle is heavily defined by its significant musical history. Between 1918 and 1951, nearly 24 jazz nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current Chinatown/International District to the Central District. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of Ernestine Anderson, Ray Charles, Quincy Jones, and others. The city is also the origin of rock acts such as Foo Fighters, Heart, and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the grunge subgenre of rock and its pioneering bands Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nfile_path: /Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt\\n\\n== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nSeattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east. The city\\'s chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs, are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington\\'s waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound).The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world\\'s few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city\\'s industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St.\\nNorth of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: Lake Union, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and Union Bay.Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. On February 28, 2001, the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage, especially in the Pioneer Square area (built on reclaimed land, as are the Industrial District and part of the city center), and caused one fatality.\\nOther strong quakes occurred on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9 magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city\\'s founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 142.5 square miles (369 km2), 83.9 square miles (217 km2) of which is land and 58.7 square miles (152 km2), water (41.16% of the total area).\\n\\n\\n=== Cityscape ===\\n--------------------\\n', tool_name='retriever', raw_input={'message': 'What is the size of Seattle?'}, raw_output=ChatMessage(role=<MessageRole.SYSTEM: 'system'>, content='You are a chatbot capable of answering questions about the data you have in English or Korean\\nContext information is below.\\n--------------------\\nfile_path: /Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt\\n\\nSeattle (  see-AT-əl; Lushootseed: dᶻidᶻəlal̕ič) is a seaport city on the West Coast of the United States.

The city is also the origin of rock acts such as Foo Fighters, Heart, and Jimi Hendrix, as well as the grunge subgenre of rock and its pioneering bands Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, and Soundgarden.\\n\\n\\n== History ==', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3108, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.6212338209152222), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='dd5b0d46-5779-41df-b1cd-dece2e307285', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_name': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 65702, 'creation_date': '2024-03-04', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-04'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='eba44892-38e1-492d-9a80-34670027feb3', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_name': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 65702, 'creation_date': '2024-03-04', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-04'}, hash='0bf306055ae49f6d373887f64dcb8b55e706ee8da7b6053b01afb0f56860b930'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='299d330c-5824-4019-805d-04974caa0863', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_name': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 65702, 'creation_date': '2024-03-04', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-04'}, hash='66faa2e04280e02c79788279bbe4f40e2c78078f3465f42099107edc61bdb1e5'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='3e78b378-faad-483a-bd17-94da101c24a8', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='6d6b773f7b95ead5f46e62cdcffdf9939739a93a721a2873911a540a55d03a20')}, text=\"== Geography ==\\n\\n\\n=== Topography ===\\n\\nSeattle is located between the saltwater Puget Sound (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and Lake Washington to the east.

To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs, are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the Hiram M.

The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St.\\nNorth of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: Lake Union, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and Union Bay.Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone.

The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding.

The city\\'s chief harbor, Elliott Bay, is part of Puget Sound, which makes the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the Kitsap Peninsula and Olympic Mountains on the Olympic Peninsula; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the Eastside suburbs, are Lake Sammamish and the Cascade Range. Lake Washington\\'s waters flow to Puget Sound through the Lake Washington Ship Canal (consisting of two man-made canals, Lake Union, and the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks at Salmon Bay, ending in Shilshole Bay on Puget Sound).The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world\\'s few sedentary hunter-gatherer societies. The surrounding area lends itself well to sailing, skiing, bicycling, camping, and hiking year-round.The city itself is hilly, though not uniformly so. Like Rome, the city is said to lie on seven hills; the lists vary but typically include Capitol Hill, First Hill, West Seattle, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Magnolia, and the former Denny Hill. The Wallingford, Delridge, Mount Baker, Seward Park, Washington Park, Broadmoor, Madrona, Phinney Ridge, Sunset Hill, Blue Ridge, Broadview, Laurelhurst, Hawthorne Hills, Maple Leaf, and Crown Hill neighborhoods are all located on hills as well. Many of the hilliest areas are near the city center, with Capitol Hill, First Hill, and Beacon Hill collectively constituting something of a ridge along an isthmus between Elliott Bay and Lake Washington. The break in the ridge between First Hill and Beacon Hill is man-made, the result of two of the many regrading projects that reshaped the topography of the city center. The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city\\'s industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St.\\nNorth of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington.

The topography of the city center was also changed by the construction of a seawall and the artificial Harbor Island (completed 1909) at the mouth of the city's industrial Duwamish Waterway, the terminus of the Green River. The highest point within city limits is at High Point in West Seattle, which is roughly located near 35th Ave SW and SW Myrtle St.\\nNorth of the city center, Lake Washington Ship Canal connects Puget Sound to Lake Washington. It incorporates four natural bodies of water: Lake Union, Salmon Bay, Portage Bay, and Union Bay.Due to its location in the Pacific Ring of Fire, Seattle is in a major earthquake zone. On February 28, 2001, the magnitude 6.8 Nisqually earthquake did significant architectural damage, especially in the Pioneer Square area (built on reclaimed land, as are the Industrial District and part of the city center), and caused one fatality.\\nOther strong quakes occurred on January 26, 1700 (estimated at 9 magnitude), December 14, 1872 (7.3 or 7.4), April 13, 1949 (7.1), and April 29, 1965 (6.5). The 1965 quake caused three deaths in Seattle directly and one more by heart failure. Although the Seattle Fault passes just south of the city center, neither it nor the Cascadia subduction zone has caused an earthquake since the city's founding. The Cascadia subduction zone poses the threat of an earthquake of magnitude 9.0 or greater, capable of seriously damaging the city and collapsing many buildings, especially in zones built on fill.According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 142.5 square miles (369 km2), 83.9 square miles (217 km2) of which is land and 58.7 square miles (152 km2), water (41.16% of the total area).\\n\\n\\n=== Cityscape ===\", start_char_idx=15761, end_char_idx=19296, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.583594799041748), NodeWithScore(node=TextNode(id_='4a58e614-a4f9-41f7-a87c-70add0aac77e', embedding=None, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_name': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 65702, 'creation_date': '2024-03-04', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-04'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={<NodeRelationship.SOURCE: '1'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='eba44892-38e1-492d-9a80-34670027feb3', node_type=<ObjectType.DOCUMENT: '4'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_name': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 65702, 'creation_date': '2024-03-04', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-04'}, hash='0bf306055ae49f6d373887f64dcb8b55e706ee8da7b6053b01afb0f56860b930'), <NodeRelationship.PREVIOUS: '2'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='829a7b86-d448-481c-8da9-77ad18e0cafd', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={'file_path': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_name': '/Users/yujiantang/Documents/workspace/rag_cookbooks/data/Seattle.txt', 'file_type': 'text/plain', 'file_size': 65702, 'creation_date': '2024-03-04', 'last_modified_date': '2024-03-04'}, hash='22b4dc53299ceeae402ed8b10d95ef2cab0224fadb608770cd426d388e6f0ec0'), <NodeRelationship.NEXT: '3'>: RelatedNodeInfo(node_id='c1d1cea3-2f7e-448a-bb64-a60771f56fdb', node_type=<ObjectType.TEXT: '1'>, metadata={}, hash='2c67df20384125a0b8eee7f06871ee4cb8d51408c2a3af372ef6f15d57cee078')}, text='Voters in the Puget Sound region approved an additional tax increase in November 2016 to expand light rail to West Seattle and Ballard as well as Tacoma, Everett, and Issaquah.\\n\\n\\n=== Utilities ===\\n\\nWater and electric power are municipal services, provided by Seattle Public Utilities and Seattle City Light respectively.
